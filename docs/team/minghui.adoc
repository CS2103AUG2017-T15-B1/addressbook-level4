`Justification`
--------------
`Find Email Command`: Some user may have very special email but their name may be difficult for a user to remember. +

For example, an English speaking user wants to collaborate with a Japanese YouTuber named Yukiko Ogawa, the name may be difficult for him to remember as Japanese is not be his/her native language. However, the Japanese YouTuber has the email catiscute@example.com, which is a lot easier for the user to remember.
 +
 +
 +
`Find Tag Command`: This makes the user's life easier as it brings out a list of YouTubers in the same genre range.
 +
 +
For example, a musician wants to collaborate with another musician to make music. However, his/her TABCC contact list +
has more than a 100 contacts. Rather than spending time looking at each contact, he/she could use the find tag command +
to look for all the musicians on his/her contact list.
 +
 +
 +
`Sort Command (ascending)`: Another command to make the user life easier.
 +
 +
For example, a user wants to look for his/her friend in the contact list, but the list is in order of when the user added the contact. +
He/she may spend a long time just to look for his friend's information. By sorting the name, the user would be 
able to know exactly where the contact is located in the list.

`Implementation`
---------------
// tag::FindEmailCommand[]
=== FindEmailCommand
This enhancement is aiming to make the searches more powerful. +
To find a person on the AddressBook, user is no longer restricted to just name search. User can now search for a person using Email. +
To use this command, user just need to type in `“findemail”` follow by a white space, and typing in the email of the person the user is trying to find. +

The implementation of the find email command consist of 3 new classes, namely `FindEmailCommand.java`, `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate.java` and `FindEmailCommandParser.java.` `FindEmailCommand.java` and `FindEmailCommandParser.java` resides in the logic component, while `EmailsContainKeywordsPredicate.java` resides in the model component. +

Figure 3.1.1 +

**Functions of classes in FindEmailCommand** +

**1)**	FindEmailCommand.java: This class search and list the persons in address book whose email contains any of the argument keyword. This class extends the abstract class Command. +

**2)**	EmailContainsKeyWordsPredicate.java: This class test that a person’s email matches any of the keyword given. This class implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> interface. +

**3)**	FindEmailCommandParser.java: This class parses input arguments and creates a new FindEmailCommand object. +

**Implementations of Find Email Command** +
The `FindEmailCommand` are implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindEmailCommand extends Command{
    @Override
    public CommandResult execute() {
	//command logic
    }
}
----

The `EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate.java` class is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate implements Predicate<ReadOnlyPerson> {
    @Override
    public boolean test(ReadOnlyPerson person) {
        //test logic
    }
}
----

Lastly, the `FindEmailCommandParser.java` is implemented this way:
[source,java]
----
public class FindEmailCommandParser {
    public FindEmailCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {
        //parser logic
    }
}
----

`Enhancement Proposed: Collab Command`
-------------------------------------
==== Automatically send an pre-wrote email to a person in the contact list: `collab`. +
This command allows a user to automatically send a pre-crafted email to a person in the contact list. +
Format: `collab [contact's name]`. +
Example: +
****
* `collab pewdiepie`
* The email page will open and a message will already be crafted, user just need to click the send button.
* Sample email: Good day to you [contact's name], this is [user's name] and I would like to do a collaboration with you, +
please reply to this email if you are interested, thank you.
* Sample email can be edit by the user.
