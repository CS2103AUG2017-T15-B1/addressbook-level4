== Project: TABCC
The Address Book for Content Creators (TABCC) is a desktop address book application targeted at content creators.

In future versions we plan to integrate other social media services like Twitch and Facebook. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. This software is written in Java, and has about 9 kLoC.
